# ⚡ Quick Start Guide - Get Archie Running in 2 Minutes

## Step 1: Get Your API Key (30 seconds)

1. Go to: https://console.anthropic.com/
2. Sign up or log in
3. Click "API Keys" in the left sidebar
4. Click "Create Key"
5. Copy the key (starts with `sk-ant-...`)

## Step 2: Configure Archie (30 seconds)

### Option A: Use the setup script (easiest)
```bash
./setup.sh
```
Paste your API key when prompted.

### Option B: Manual setup
```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Then edit .env and paste your API key
```

## Step 3: Run Archie (10 seconds)

```bash
npm start
```

You should see:
```
🤖 Archie is running on http://localhost:3000
📋 API Key configured: Yes
```

## Step 4: Open Your Browser

Go to: **http://localhost:3000**

## Step 5: Test It Out!

Try this example:

**Product Idea:**
```
An app for doctors to securely share patient MRI scans with specialists.
Patients can also view their own scans and chat with their doctors.
```

**Settings:**
- Users: 100-1,000 (Small Launch)
- Compliance: Healthcare (HIPAA Required)
- Skill Level: Intermediate (Can code but new to deployment)
- Timeline: 1-3 months (MVP)

Click "Generate My Architecture Blueprint" and watch the magic! ✨

## Troubleshooting

### "API Key configured: No"
- Make sure your `.env` file exists
- Make sure it contains `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...`
- Restart the server after creating `.env`

### "Failed to generate architecture"
- Check your API key is valid
- Make sure you have API credits in your Anthropic account
- Check the console for error messages

### Port 3000 already in use
Edit `.env` and change:
```
PORT=3001
```
Then access at http://localhost:3001

## What to Demo at the Hackathon

1. **Show the form** - "Notice how we ask about compliance"
2. **Submit a healthcare example** - "Watch it detect HIPAA requirements"
3. **Show the diagram** - "This is generated by AI in real-time"
4. **Explain the tech stack** - "It justifies every choice"
5. **Show the first steps** - "Non-technical founders can follow this"

## Pro Tips

### Best Demo Ideas

**Healthcare:**
"Telemedicine platform for rural areas"
→ Shows HIPAA compliance, video streaming, scalability

**Payments:**
"Peer-to-peer payment app for college students"
→ Shows PCI-DSS, fraud detection, user authentication

**High Scale:**
"Social media platform for Gen Z"
→ Shows scalability, CDN, database sharding

**Student Project:**
"Class note-sharing app for my university"
→ Shows beginner-friendly stack, low cost

### The "WOW" Moment

The magic happens when:
1. User sees their vague idea become a professional diagram
2. Archie catches compliance requirements they didn't know existed
3. The tech stack is explained in plain English

## Next Steps After the Demo

Ideas to extend this:
1. Add user accounts (save blueprints)
2. Make it conversational (replace form with chat)
3. Add "Export to PDF" button
4. Generate starter code for the recommended stack
5. Add cost comparison between different cloud providers
